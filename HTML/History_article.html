 <div class="flex-item-right"><p><h3><mark>Elvis Presley</h3></mark>
“Medical specialists reported on a story which isn’t news to most colonic irrigation therapists – Elvis Presley died
of chronic constipation according to his doctor, Dr. Nick Nichopoulos.When I first started colon hydrotherapy treatment
as detoxification, the I-ACT certified therapist administering it gave a lot of insight into Elvis’ diet. It made me 
consider my own food choices better and through that 10 session program I came to understand in much more detail how
foods affected my moods, health and wellbeing.Constipation isn’t healthy. It’s very common yet most people ignore their 
symptoms. If you ignore toxin symptoms, they can easily accumulate in your system and turn into something far worse.
Colon cancer kills far too many people every year. According to numerous cancer research cases, lifetime chances of
contracting colorectal cancer are 1 in 16 for men and 1 in 20 for women.ELVIS PRESLEY DEAD – August 16, 1977, at age
42 years, in the bathroom at Graceland.The King of bacon, banana and peanut butter sandwiches, didn’t die of a heart
condition. He succumbed, on the toilet, to chronic constipation. He was going into his bathroom “to read” for a while. 
The book he took in with him, interestingly enough, was The Face Of Jesus, by Frank Adams.That’s the word from Presley’s 
longtime friend and personal physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos, who said The King’s insides were All Shook Up
– and not in a good way.“We didn’t realize until the autopsy that his constipation was as bad – we knew it was bad because
it was hard for us to treat, but we didn’t realize what it had done,” the doctor explains of Elvis’ condition. “We just
assumed that the constipation was secondary to the meds that he was taking for his arthritic pain and for his insomnia.”
According to Dr. Nick, the autopsy revealed that Presley’s colon was 5 to 6 inches in diameter (whereas the normal width
is 2 to 3 inches) and instead of being the standard 4 to 5 feet long, his colon was 8 to 9 feet in length.“The constipation
upset him quite a bit because Elvis thought that he could handle almost anything, he thought he was really a man’s man 
and he wasn’t going to let something like this … he thought that this was a sign of weakness and he wasn’t going to be
weak,” Nichopoulos said. “And it’s not the kind of thing you table talk. Back in the ‘60s and ‘70s you didn’t’ talk about
constipation much, you didn’t’ hear people complaining about it, or saying what they did or how much trouble they
had with it.”” (renewedhealthassocs, n.d.)</p></div>

<div class="flex-item-right-below"> <p><h3><mark>Deadliest wars</h3></mark>
“The ten deadliest wars:<br>
• Napoleonic Wars<br>
• Russian Civil War<br>
• Dungan Revolt<br>
• Conquests of Timur/Tamerlane<br>
• Qing conquest of Ming<br>
• An Lushan Rebellion<br>
• Mongol Conquests<br>
• WW1<br>
• Taiping Rebellion<br>
• WW2<br>
• Napoleonic Wars: 3.3–6.6 million deaths<br>
No, they were only in Europe, and small parts of Africa and South America.
Russian Civil War: 5–9 million deaths
Uh, well the Japanese invaded Vladivostok through China so maybe? Probably not.
Dungan Revolt: ~8 million
This was an uprising of the Hui people, who were Chinese Muslims, so yes.
Conquests of Timur/Tamerlane: Unknown but its around this area
Since the Ming Dynasty claimed that Timur was a vassal of the Chinese, he planned a war, but that never happened, so no.
Qing conquest of Ming: Again, unknown, but around here
The Qing Conquest of Ming was literally the Manchu peoples taking over China from the Ming Dynasty.
An Lushan Rebellion: Possibly up to 36 million deaths
That was an attempt by An Lushan to take over China. Yes.
Mongol Conquests: 40–70 million deaths
One of the first places they invaded was China.
WW1: I realized this was out of order here. WW1 was about 37 million deaths.
There were the Chinese concessions owned by Germany, which Japan invaded. Later, China joined the war, but I don’t think they did very much.
Taiping Rebellion again, out of order. 20–30 million deaths.
So some Chinese guy thought he was the younger brother of Jesus and tried to take over China.
WW2: 40–85 million deaths.
Well, if you count the Second Sino-Japanese War, it actually started in 1937. The US supported China, and the War is considered a front of WW2
Six were definitely Chinese (Dungan, Ming/Qing, An Lushan, Mongol, WW2)
One was probably Chinese (WW1)
One was iffy (Russia)
One was going to involve China, but didn’t (Timur)
And one wasn’t in Asia (Napoleon)
By my logic, it is true that seven of the ten deadliest wars involved China.” (Rudoff, 2018)

 <div class="flex-item-left"><p><h3><mark>Tanks and beverage</mark></h3>
“This might just be the most British thing imaginable, even compared to a bulldog in a Union Jack sweater, mated 
with a pile of PAL-format Monty Python VHS tapes while force-feeding it a pureéd Sinclair Spectrum mixed with Heinz 
baked beans. This raw, uncut Britishness I’m talking about is the fact that every British tank made since WWII has
on-board equipment specifically designed to make tea.I suppose this is a reasonably well-known fact, though it was
news to me when I learned about it recently, so I’m going to assume I can’t be the only one who was in the dark about 
this amazing detail and do my best to let all you wonderful readers know, too.You’d think the horrors and limitations
of wartime life would have quelled the need for a nice cup of tea for soldiers, but, apparently, the British are not 
about to give up the one worthwhile aspect of civilization just because of some inconvenient trivia like a global
war.” (Torchinsky, 2019)</p></div>

<div class="flex-item-left-below"><p><h3><mark>Victorians and photos</h3></mark>
“We’ve all had a camera pointed in our face with someone telling us to “say cheese” at one point or another. Chances are you’ve been on
the other side directing someone with the classic shutterbug slogan, too. But back in the Victorian era, folks were told to blurt out a 
completely different type of food while posing for photos.Britain’s first portrait photographer, Richard Beard, reportedly asked his 
subjects to “say prunes” in order to get the best image while working in the 1840s. The dour look on their faces may certainly reflect 
a lot of our feelings about the dried fruit, but he wasn’t asking them to say it just to put them in a bad mood. Instead, Beard was trying
to ensure their mouths looked as small and refined as possible. Apparently, it was bad form to look too jolly or happy in the Victorian era. 
“Etiquette codes of the past demanded that the mouth be carefully controlled,” explained Historian Christina Kotchemidova. The word “prunes”
does seem like it’d get that desired effect.” (Catcher, 2019)</p></div>

<div class="flex-item-last"><p><h3><mark>Great fire of London</mark></h3>“The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept
through the central parts of London from Sunday, 2 September to Thursday, 6 September 1666. The fire gutted the medieval City of London 
inside the old Roman city wall. The death toll is generally thought to have been relatively small, although some historians have 
challenged this belief.The fire started in a bakery shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September, and spread rapidly. The use of the major
firefighting technique of the time, the creation of firebreaks by means of demolition, was critically delayed due to the indecisiveness of 
the Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the 
bakery fire into a firestorm which defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday into the heart of the City. Order in the streets 
broke down as rumours arose of suspicious foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's 
enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of street violence. On Tuesday, the fire 
spread over nearly the whole City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall. 
Coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously getting underway. The battle to put out the fire is considered to have been won by two 
key factors: the strong east wind dropped, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks, halting further 
spread eastward.The social and economic problems created by the disaster were overwhelming. Flight from London and settlement elsewhere were 
strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees. Various schemes for rebuilding the city 
were proposed, some of them very radical. After the fire, London was reconstructed on essentially the same medieval street plan which still
exists today.”(wikipedia, 2022) </p></div>
